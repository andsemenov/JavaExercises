I did yoga classes when I was in school. it wasn't easy but I was working hard to become fit. when I started doing yoga classes every day. I felt happy having a great time. At the start period, it was difficult for me because I didn't flexible. after 3 or 4month I participated in a yoga competition and I got a medal from my school. when I was 18 years old everyone said to me your age not look like 18 I think you are 14 or 13 now. really I was looking like 14. after my school I joined doing yoga in my house and still I am 26 and my weight 42.
